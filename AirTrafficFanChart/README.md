I'd like to acknowledge **Irina Demko** for her insightful work on fan charts, which I encountered during my studies and which served as the inspiration for this project. The fan chart concept is derived from the car accident chart.

ðŸŽ¯ **This analysis utilizes a flight database from an SQL course.** 
- Data manipulation and retrieval were performed using PostgreSQL. 
- Due to Tableau's incompatibility with .sql files, Excel was employed as an intermediary for data preparation.
- Tableau was the primary visualization tool used for this analysis.
